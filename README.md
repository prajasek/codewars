Why Codewars?
----------------
1. Codewars is one of many websites that lets you practice, solve challenging coding problems in a plethora of languages (I mainly focus on Python and 
C++).
 
2. You get to see other people's solutions to understand where you can enhance your coding skills, and to get different methods (some very 
clever) of solving the same problems. 

3. This is the ultimate way of learning by doing -

         Solve a problem -> See others' solutions ->  Know that you are surrounded by much smarter people than you ->
         Learn from them on how to code better -> Repeat.
